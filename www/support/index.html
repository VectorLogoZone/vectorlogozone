        <h3>Can I use these images without royalties/attribution/etc?</h3>
        <p>I am not the copyright/trademark/etc owner of any<sup>*</sup> of these.  Use them at your own risk.</p>
        <p>If you are the owner and do not want your logo here, please let me know (nicely) and I will be glad to remove it.
        No lawyers necessary: just <a href="https://github.com/VectorLogoZone/vectorlogozone/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on github!
        Alternatively, it would be great if you provided the appropriately sized images yourself.</p>

        <h3>Can I hotlink the images, or do I have to make my own copy?</h3>
        <p>I originally wasn't going to allow hotlinking, but CloudFlare promises unlimited free bandwidth, so I changed my
	   mind.  Unless CloudFlare changes their mind, hotlink away!</p>
        <p>I always appreciate a link back (using a <a href="/logos/vectorlogozone/">VectorLogoZone logo</a> naturally!), but it isn't required.</p>

        <h3>How reliable is the site?</h3>
        <p>It is a static site, so it should be quite reliable.  You can check the <a href="https://nodeping.com/reports/checks/wbe44oj5-13fx-4h6l-8ojp-tlbno9b01gmu">recent uptime report</a> to see for yourself!</p>
        <p>That said, there are no guarantees.  Feel free to host the images you use on your own servers (though I would still like that backlink!).</p>

        <h3>Why only vector images? </h3>
        <p>Vector images look so much better, especially on high-resolution displays, and don't require any of the 
	   hacks needed for responsive images: they &ldquo;just work&rdquo;!</p>

        <h3>So why the raster <code>card</code> images? </h3>
        <p><i>Sigh</i>.  Unfortunately, certain websites (*cough* Facebook and Twitter *cough*) only support raster
        images for the thumbnail when you share a page.</p>

        <h3>Will my users be able to see them?</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-img">Can I Use</a>, 96% will be able to see them.  It is probably quite a bit higher than that, since
        most of the remaining 4% support it, just not with embedded data URIs, which should not be in any of these SVGs.</p>

        <h3>But I really want to support IE8!</h3>
        <p>I have seen several different ways: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-svg-fallbacks/">picture, image</a> and <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/graceful-fallback-svgs-old-ie/">onerror</a>. Good luck!</p>

        <h3>These images suck!  Can't you do any better?</h3>
        <p>I am definitely <i>not</i> an artist, and generally do not do anything besides resize and rearrange existing artwork.</p>
        <p>It can often be difficult to get the images to looks nice on their own and look good and consistant with the rest of the images.</p>
